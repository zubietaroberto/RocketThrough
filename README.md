# RocketThrough

Cocos 2D-X v3.11 project, made using example code from Roger Engelbert's book [_Cocos 2d-x By Example - Second Edition_](http://www.amazon.com/Cocos2d-x-Example-Beginners-Guide-Second/dp/1785288857/). The code had to be overhauled to support Cocos v3.11 and to be able to compile in Windows, Linux and Android.

## Compiling
1. Download and install Cocos2D-x.
2. `git pull`
2. Copy the cocos 2d v3.11 library in a folder called `cocos2d` inside the project.
3. Compile using the `cocos compile` command. Supported platforms below

## Supported Platforms
To compile use the following commands:

1. Linux: `cocos run -p linux`
2. Android Gradle (Both armeabi and x86): `cocos run -p android --android-studio`
3. Windows Win32: `cocos run -p win32`

## Special thanks
Roger Engelbert for his book.
